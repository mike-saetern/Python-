#built in functions in sequence
# max(sequence) returns the largest value in the sequence
# sum(sequence) returns the sum of all values in sequence
# map(function, sequence) applies the function to every item in the sequence you pass in. Returns a list of the results.
# min(sequence) returns the lowest value in a sequence.
# sorted(sequence) returns a sorted list of the sequence's values
